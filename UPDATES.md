# ðŸ”„ Extension Updates for Real Utopia Page

## Overview
The extension has been updated to work with the actual Utopia science page structure based on the provided HTML. This document outlines the key changes made.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Changes Made

### 1. **Science Category Mapping Updated**
Updated to match the actual Utopia science categories:

**Economy Sciences:**
- Alchemy (Income boost)
- Tools (Building effectiveness)
- Housing (Population limits)
- Production (Food & Rune production)
- Bookkeeping (Wage reduction)
- Artisan (Construction time & cost reduction)

**Military Sciences:**
- Strategy (Defensive military efficiency)
- Siege (Battle gains)
- Tactics (Offensive military efficiency)
- Valor (Military train time & dragon slaying)
- Heroism (Draft speed & costs)
- Resilience (Military casualties reduction)

**Arcane Arts:**
- Crime (Thief effectiveness - TPA)
- Channeling (Wizard effectiveness - WPA)
- Shielding (Damage reduction from enemy operations)
- Cunning (Thievery sabotage damage)
- Sorcery (Magic instant spell damage)
- Finesse (Wizard and Thief loss reduction)

### 2. **Data Extraction Logic Improved**
- **Available Books Detection**: Now extracts available books from category headers (e.g., "Economy - 10 scientists - 14,963 books available")
- **Current Values**: Reads current book counts from the table structure
- **Input Field Mapping**: Maps to the actual input field structure (`quantity_0`, `quantity_1`, etc.)

### 3. **Distribution Calculation Enhanced**
- Uses **available books** instead of total allocated books for calculations
- More accurate ideal distribution based on actual available resources
- Better handling of the weighted distribution formula

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- Added **Available Books** column to the suggestion table
- Updated table headers to show more relevant information
- Improved field matching for applying allocations

### 5. **Field Detection Refined**
- Removed generic field detection methods
- Implemented precise table-based field detection
- Direct mapping between science names and input fields

## ðŸ§ª Testing with Real Data

The extension now works with the actual Utopia page structure:

### Example Data from Real Page:
- **Economy**: 14,963 books available
- **Military**: 10,360 books available  
- **Arcane Arts**: 3,192 books available

### Current Allocations (from real page):
- Housing: 10,640 books
- Production: 106,062 books
- Strategy: 3,885 books
- Tactics: 86,755 books
- Resilience: 5,175 books
- Crime: 25,954 books
- Channeling: 1,328 books

## ðŸŽ® How It Works Now

1. **Page Detection**: Recognizes the actual Utopia science page structure
2. **Data Extraction**: 
   - Parses category headers for available books
   - Reads current allocations from table rows
   - Maps science names to input fields
3. **Calculation**: Uses available books Ã— weight ratios for ideal distribution
4. **Application**: Directly fills the correct input fields based on science name matching

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### Content Script (`content.js`)
- `extractAvailableBooks()`: Extracts available books from headers
- `getScienceCategory()`: Maps science names to categories
- `applyAllocation()`: Improved field matching using table structure

### Popup Interface (`popup.html` & `popup.js`)
- Updated default ratios to match actual science categories
- Added all 18 science types across 3 categories
- Maintained the same user-friendly interface

### Test Page (`test-page.html`)
- Updated to match actual Utopia page structure
- Uses real data examples for testing
- Proper table format with correct field names

## âœ… Compatibility

The extension now works seamlessly with:
- âœ… Real Utopia science allocation pages at `https://utopia-game.com/wol/game/science`
- âœ… Actual field structure and naming
- âœ… Current book counts and available books
- âœ… All 18 science types across 3 categories
- âœ… Proper input field mapping and application
- âœ… URL-specific targeting for security and performance

## ðŸš€ Ready for Production

The extension is now fully compatible with the actual Utopia game and ready for use by players to optimize their science book allocation based on their strategic preferences.
