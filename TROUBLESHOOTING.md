# üîß Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Calculate Distribution" Button Not Appearing

If you can't find the "Calculate Distribution" button, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Check the URL
Make sure you're on the correct page:
- ‚úÖ **Correct**: `https://utopia-game.com/wol/game/science`
- ‚ùå **Wrong**: Any other Utopia page (throne, military, etc.)

### Step 2: Check Browser Console
1. **Open Developer Tools**: Press `F12` or right-click ‚Üí "Inspect"
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for messages** starting with "Utopia Science Allocator"
4. **Check the debug output** - it will show:
   - Current URL
   - Page detection results
   - Whether UI was injected

### Step 3: Reload the Extension
1. **Go to** `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Find** "Utopia Science Allocator"
3. **Click the refresh/reload button** (üîÑ)
4. **Go back** to the Utopia science page
5. **Refresh the page** (F5)

### Step 4: Check Extension Permissions
1. **Go to** `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Find** "Utopia Science Allocator"
3. **Click "Details"**
4. **Check** that it has access to the current site
5. **If not**, click "Allow access to file URLs" or similar

### Step 5: Manual Debugging
If the button still doesn't appear, try this in the browser console:

```javascript
// Check if the extension is loaded
console.log('Extension loaded:', typeof UtopiaScienceAllocator !== 'undefined');

// Check if the container exists
console.log('Container exists:', document.getElementById('utopia-science-allocator'));

// Manually trigger the extension
if (typeof UtopiaScienceAllocator !== 'undefined') {
  new UtopiaScienceAllocator();
}
```

### Step 6: Check Page Content
The extension looks for these elements on the page:
- ‚úÖ Science-related text (alchemy, tools, tactics, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Input fields for science allocation
- ‚úÖ Table structure with science data
